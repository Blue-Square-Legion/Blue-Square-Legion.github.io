## Types of Meetings

This will give you a quick rundown of the kinds of meeting your team can have.
You don't need limit yourselves to this, if you have another kind of meeting, you can do that.

<WhyNote>
Sometimes it is hard to know what to do in each day, so this can provide some guidence or inspriation for what to do.

### Brainstorming Meeting

**Goal: Generate ideas for the project**

Time: As long as the team want to, but decide upfront how long, and if it is more than an hour, please add breaks.

Allow team members to create ideas for the project, do simple voting on favorites. 
In this case, you do not need to explicitly care about scope of the project.
Make sure all ideas are discussed to the best of their ability (you don't need to weed out ideas any at this stage). 

### Planning Meetings

**Goal: Determine plan for project**

Time: Ideally less than an hour, but depends on setup time

Have team members plan out the project, including: 
adding and assigning tasks, 
determining overall style (i.e. art and sound style), 
and do any setup (e.g., create GitHub repository and make sure people have access).

### Checking Meeting

**Goal: Check were each team member is at for their task.**

Time: Between 15-30 minutes, depending on team size

_Similar to daily scrum or stand-up meetings_

This meeting is to check where everyone is at with their assigned tasks.
Check for what tasks are completed, what tasks are planning, and issues (blockers) people are having with completing tasks.
People can be assigned new tasks if they have finished one.
Producers should lead to make sure project is progressing.

**This kind of meeting should be as short as possible.**

### Accountability/Pair Programming Session

**Goal: Work on tasks for the project 1-on-1**

Time: Around an hour

Two members meet at a designated time to work on their tasks together. 
There does not need to be any conversation while working on the tasks, but feel free to discuss if you would like to.
Tasks do not have to be the same or even related (e.g., an artist and programmer can work together).

_For accountability proof for P1, make a comment before you start about what you plan to do, then at the end, post what you accomplished, and take a screenshot (only one person posts for proof)._

### Administrative Meeting

**Goal: Complete administrative work**

Time: As long as the team want to, but decide upfront how long, and if it is more than an hour, please add breaks.

Team members meet to complete administrative work together.
