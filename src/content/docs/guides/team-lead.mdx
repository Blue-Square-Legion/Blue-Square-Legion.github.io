## What is a Team Lead

This is the leader of the team.
They are the guiding hand of the project.
**Every team must have exactly one leader.**

### Electing

A team lead is elected by a team by a simple majority (50%).
Voting does not necessarily need to be formal, but every team member should know who their team lead is.

If a majority (at least 60%) of team members feel like someone else would be a better leader,
they may choose to replace the leader.
This can also occur when team leader leaves.

### Powers

These are the main powers a team lead has:

  We are a volunteer group, so leader should try to make sure the project is achievable by the team.

## Difference with Producer Role

There is a lot of overlap between team lead and producer. 
However, any role may choose to be a team lead.

The main difference is in scope: a team lead manages the overall vision of the project,
while a producer focuses more on the actual details (e.g., tasks, what is completed, meetings).
Team lead may choose to lead certain meeting, while leaving other meetings for producers.
