## The Council

Instead of one person leading a legion, we operate as a democratic council, with all members having a say in the direction of the legion.

<WhyNote>
  A legion leader can lead up to 12 teams and also be a leader of a team of up to 12 member. 
  This make it difficult for one person to manage everything, especially if they are **volunteering**.

  Having multiple people can help prevent one person from taking on all the responsibilities and bruning out in the process.
</WhyNote>

### Who is included

Anyone who meets one of these criteria:

<MakeList tag="ul" data={frontmatter.lists.councilMembers}/>


<WhyNote>
  Team leads are included so they can learn from other leaders and pass knowledge to rest of the team.

  T4 member or higher are included as they have gone through the process multiple time, and so can give pointers to new members.
</WhyNote>

These members can shadow the process:

<MakeList tag="ul" data={frontmatter.lists.shandowMembers}/>

<WhyNote>
  T2 and T3 members are starting to get a feel for the process, and this would be a good time to learn what being part of the concil entails.
</WhyNote>

## Responsibilities

At minimum, the concil should decide on how to delegate the following responsibilities:

<MakeList tag="ul" data={frontmatter.lists.responsibilities}/>

### Legion Commander

There will only be exactly one legion commander. 
They may take any of the above responsibilities, but they are mainly to serve as the point person for the Ignite Host to the legion.

Legion Commander is elected by a simple majority vote from all members within the legion.
