- [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) (built on [Astro](https://astro.build)) for Static Site Generator and Theming

- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com) as UI Library (alongside [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)):
<WhyNote>
Flowbite provides lots of components for many JS frameworks, Tailwind CSS is helpful for quick inlining of styles.
